# Big Bang Theory Decision Maker

While the title may suggest otherwise this is simply an extended version of rock paper scissor with two added elements of lizard and spock. This game can be played amongst many people especially when making a final decision. Can be used to settle where to eat, what movie to watch etc.

## Introduction

Rock paper scissors lizard spock appeared in an episode of Big Bang Theory titled "The Lizard-Spock Expansion. Sheldon one of the main characters of the show gives a brief history and explains the new rules. As mentioned before this game can be played amongst multiple people. These individuals make their choices and display them simultaneously to prevent anyone from changing at the last second. The sign for rock is a "closed fist", paper is a "horizontal peace sign", paper is a "horizontal flat hand with plam facing down". Now comes the additions lizard is "all fingers meet thumb horizontally almost like making a set of jaws", and lastly is spock which has three groupings of fingers "fingers and thumbs pointed to sky like a high five, thumb is by itself then a gap, then pointer and middle finger together then a gap and lastly ring and pinky finger together. I have attached a link for viewer pleasure to showcase where I got my motivation for this game from. [Game Motivation](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock)

## Game Play

In a normal game players can say rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock then show their choice against the other players choice. In this project the player will get to select which of the five choices they would like (rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock) and upon selecting the preferred choice button the computer randomizes its choice amongst the exact same options.
Both player and computer choices are then displayed instantly, along with who won and an increase of one point on the scoreboard to whomever won. If there is a tie the scores remain unchanged from previous round. This round of play will continues until the overall game ends when someone reaches 10 first and has a special message displayed. In other words if the player is tied with the computer at 9-9 whoever wins the round to get to 10 wins the game! Players also have a choice to replay due to pressing their luck (if they won) or proving the computer's taunting wrong (for losing the game).

## Rules:

The firstI have included two legends to utilize while making your decision. One legend has visual symbols used in case my descriptions were hard to follow. Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock add additional elements and rules to follow. Before lizard and spock were added there were only 3 rules to follow: 

- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Scissors

Now with the addition of lizard and spock the rules go up to 10:

- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- and as it always has been Rock crushes Scissors
